# BackEnd-Commerce

This application is e-commerce back end terminal code used to identify and generate product taglines, as well as other relevant product information. The headache of keeping track of product location, category listings, item descriptions are solved with this basic application. Using GET, POST and PUT requests, we are able to create, read, update and delete data [CRUD].

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
